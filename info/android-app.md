### Known Issues
- Multiple-device discovery and control via Bluetooth is currently slow
- We have tested the app on a limited number of devices, so please let us know if you encounter any issues! 
- If you are struggling to connect to the device via Bluetooth, you may connect it to WiFi first via the GLORB Access Point (see [Initial Setup Guide](/setup#glorb-access-point))

## WLED Controls
